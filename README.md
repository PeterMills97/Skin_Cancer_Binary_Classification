# Skin_Cancer_Binary_Classification
Here are a couple notebooks I used to experiment on a skin cancer classification dataset taken from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kylegraupe/skin-cancer-binary-classification-dataset

The aim of this project was to teach myself how to more effectively use a Keras pretrained computer vison model, I settled on VGG16 for this purpose. I had previously done some similar tasks as part of Andrew Ng's deep learning specialisation on Coursera, but found that doing this independently threw up some interesting lessons. Here are my main take aways:

1) Initailly keep things simple, I was really impressed with the performance that the pretrained model offerd and I did not need to add any additional complexity to get a decent model.
2) Plan how you are going to record model perfomance and the information you get from experiment with different things. Unlike the traditional machine learning I had done previously, training the models was considerably more time consuming. This made it far more important to learn from the models that I had trained.
3) I should learn techniques such as streaming data to allow me to use larger image datasets for future projects.
